He based\nit on the Latin word fractus which means \"broken\" or \"fractured\".\nA fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which pattern\nremains the same at every scale.</p>\n<h2>Equations</h2>\n<p>The Mandelbrot and Julia set is calculated by iterating the equation</p>\n<p>zn+1 = zn2 + c</p>\n<p>where i = âˆš-1 and x and y are the horizontal and vertical position of the location within the fractal whose color you wish to calculate.</p>\n<p>The calculation is repeated until |zn| > 2, and colors are assigned to each location depending on the number of iterations required until this condition is met.</p>\n<p>A maximum number of iterations needs to be specified, because in some parts of the fractal, the iteration sequence above will never end. This is true in the 'lake' area in the center of the fractal.</p>\n<h2>Mandelbrot Set</h2>\n<p>The starting conditions are</p>\n<p>Z0 = 0</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>c = x + iy</p>\n<h2>Julia Set</h2>\n<p>The starting conditions are</p>\n<p>Z0 = x + iy</p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p>c = x0 + iy0</p>\n<p>x0 and y0 are two numerical constants which define a two-dimensional set of different Julia sets.</p>\n<h2>usage</h2>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$./fractol\nusage: fractol &#x3C;set> [-c x y] [-z number] [-m number] [-p palette] | [-h | --help]\n\t&#x3C;set>: {mandelbrot | mandelbrot1 | mandelbrot3 | julia | burningship}\n\t-c x y: center point where x and y are float numbers between (-2, 2)\n\t-z number: zoom where number is a float number > 0\n\t-m number: max iteration where number is a float number > 0\n\t-p palette: color palette {redmoon | white | trip | lsd}\n\t-h or --help: to display this message\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>mandelbrot</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/projects/dynamic-routing/mandelbrot.png\" alt=\"mandelbrot\"></p>\n<h3>Julia lsd</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/projects/dynamic-routing/julia_lsd.png\" alt=\"julia_lsd\"></p>\n<h3>Julia trip</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/projects/dynamic-routing/julia_trip.png\" alt=\"julia_trip\"></p>\n<h3>burningship</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/projects/dynamic-routing/burningship.png\" alt=\"burningship\"></p>\n<h3>burningship julia</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/projects/dynamic-routing/burningship_julia.png\" alt=\"burningship_julia\"></p>\n<h3>burningship julia trip</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/projects/dynamic-routing/burningship_julia_trip.png\" alt=\"burningship_julia_trip\"></p>","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/projects/dynamic-routing/mandelbrot.png"},"coverImage":"/assets/projects/dynamic-routing/mandelbrot.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
